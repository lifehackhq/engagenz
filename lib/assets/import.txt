Psychiatrists
Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialise in mental-health problems. They are able to prescribe medication for mental health problems. The easiest way to access a psychiatrist is to visit your GP and ask for a referral through the public system - public psychiatrists usually work from local Community Mental-Health Centres (CMHC). You can find your local CMHC in the front of your phone book or ask your GP to refer you. You usually need a referral from your GP to see a psychiatrist at a CMHC, but there's no harm in ringing them up to find out more first because different services have their own processes. There are also private psychiatrists in many communities - your GP may also be able to help you find a private psychiatrist.

For urgent assistance, including after hours, 7 days a week call your crisis team.

Psychologists, Counsellors and Psychotherapists

If you can’t find what you are looking for in this section, be sure to check through the Support Services section, where Community Mental-Health Centres are listed. CMHCs usually also provide access to psychologists or counsellors. 

The experiences we describe as mental unwellness are changeable.  There are a number of effective talking therapies for each diagnosis and type of distress, but every person has different needs.  

Psychologists, counsellors and psychotherapists each have a different approach to therapy. There is more information about these differences in the Treatment Approaches Information Pack. A psychotherapist tends to have an approach that focuses on understanding how you operate in the world today in relation to your early experiences. Psychotherapists often have a long-term focus as they aim to work out the dynamics of your life within the relationship between client and therapist. In this manner, you learn new ways of being in the world. A counsellor works a lot like a psychotherapist, but they tend to focus more on current problems and how you are reacting to them. A counsellor will talk through your experiences with you and help you to find your way. Psychologists who work as therapists tend to be Clinical Psychologists or Counselling Psychologists. Psychologists have a more structured, scientific approach to therapy. They are more likely to use approaches like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, because their professional code demands they only use evidence-based techniques. They will tend to focus on identifying what triggers and maintains your unwanted experiences and setting up opportunities to learn ways to change them.  Clinical Psychologists are specifically trained to provide evidence-based treatments for mental disorder diagnoses. 

Research suggests that regardless of the approach, the most important factor in any effective therapy is the quality of your relationship with the therapist themselves. It can take some time to find just the right person and approach for you. An effective practitioner of any kind will take your opinions, beliefs, culture and dignity into consideration when treating you; in fact, it is their obligation to do so.  If you find that this is not happening, it is important that you raise it with them, so they can overcome this barrier with you or you can find someone who will.  
Practitioners who will teach you a combination of thought-based techniques and practical behavioural strategies, but also allow room for you to explore deeper issues, are particularly useful. 
An ideal practitioner would have a firm understanding of your diagnostic label, if you have one, but always see beyond it.  You are a whole person and need to be treated as such.   
Don’t be afraid to ask your practitioner for the kind of approach and style of interaction you want or feel you need.  This is something most therapists greatly appreciate. If you want more of something, or less of something else, let them know. 
Make sure you check your therapist is a member of the appropriate professional body. A counsellor should be a member of the New Zealand Association of Counsellors (NZAC). A psychologist should be a member of The New Zealand Psychologists Board (NZPB). A psychotherapist should be a member of The Psychotherapists Board of Aotearoa New Zealand (PBANZ). 

You have a right to effective treatment, so if you do not think that you are getting the results you hoped for, it is important you raise this with your practitioner too – again, it will allow them to identify and resolve barriers with you.  

There is an e-book that you might find helps you prepare for the therapy process and get the most out of it. “How to Make the Most out of Your Therapy: A Guide for Clients receiving Talking Therapies from Psychologists, Counsellors and other Mental Health Professionals”. This easy to read guide is designed for clients who are planning to enter into a talking-based therapy with mental health professionals (e.g. psychologist, counsellor or other professional therapist). This text is designed to give you, the client, a "head start" in your therapeutic relationship to increase the likelihood of you having a useful experience and make the most of your "treatment dollar".This text is published as an e-book at the following link: www.amazon.com/Make-Most-Your-Therapy-ebook/dp/B006WW9L2S

There is a blog by Dr Alice Boyes which may also be useful.

ACC Registered Psychologists, Psychotherapists & Counsellors: There is an extensive list of registered psychologists, therapists and counsellors on the ACC website.  This is a list of professionals who are specialised in treating people who have experience of sexual abuse and mental ‘illness’ diagnoses.  These therapists also tend to be experienced in dealing with a wide range of diagnoses and areas of concern, unrelated to sexual abuse, so this list might help anyone find a practitioner that works for them.  
If you experienced sexual abuse before the age of 12, you may qualify for subsidised access to one of these therapists.  Ask your GP about Sensitive Claims.

Service User Movement
The Service-User Movement is a global revolution, led by people who have used mental-health services and are working to contribute to their improvement. All around the world, different organisations, community groups and services have evolved to enable people with experience of unwellness to be able to connect with each other’s experiences, explore perspectives, inform their services and help educate their communities about the realities of mental unwellness and recovery. These services are based on the core belief that people who have learned to manage mental unwellness have great skills and insights to share about the human condition.
